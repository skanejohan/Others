- Go to the kitchen
- Open the cupboard
- Take the cup. A key is revealed.
- Take the key
- Go to the history section
- Unlock the office door with the key
- Open the door
- Go to the office

Goal: find the hidden secret
- Open the safe (combination 1979, as per the plaque in the outer room, although there are many red herrings in the office)
- In the safe you find a book about the house in what is presumably latin.
- Take the book
- Go to the travel and language section
- Examine the language bookshelf - a latin dictionary is revealed (since you hold the old book)
- Get the latin dictionary
- Now examine the book about the house - this reveals the secret - a secret door in the eastern wall of what is now the history section.

Goal: reveal the secret door
- Go to the history section
- Remove the books from the shelf on the eastern side of the room. This reveals an old brick wall.
- Go to the office
- In the desk are a number of things, get the paper clip.
- There is a large cupboard filled with a lot of stuff. Get the small metal box - you remember it from your childhood... stamps? your stone collection?
- Examine the metal box. This reveals its lock.
- Pick the lock with the paper clip and open the box.
- It contains your old stone collection. Examine the stones. This reveals a small axe (term?).
- Get the small axe. 
- Go to the history section
- As you are about to strike the wall, the bell at the front door rings and you move to the fiction section. 

Goal: hide the truth from uncle Ailbert
- It is your rich uncle (you need his money, so you don't want to strike the wall while he is here)
- Talk to your uncle, offering him a cup of tea
- Go to the kitchen
- Make some tea
- Give the tea to your uncle.
- Your uncle drinks the tea, then excuses himself and disappears into the bathroom, locking the door behind him.

Goal: reveal the secret door (again)
- Go to the history section
- Strike the wall with the small axe. An opening is revealed.

Cut-scene: discussing how you remember discussions about the ghosts in the basement.

Goal: Meet the ghosts
- Enter the opening. It is dark and you can't continue.
- Go to the kitchen. Open the broom cupboard. Take the flashlight. 
- Go to the history section. 
- Enter the opening. You walk down the stairs and end up in a small room with stone walls. Hovering in the air is the ghost of a young woman.  

Goal: Make friends with a ghost
- Try to go east. The ghost prevents you from going that way.
- Go south. You are in another stone room. A well-dressed, very handsome ghost (19th centrury?) hovers here. 
- Talk to the ghost. It turns out that he wants to dance with you.
- Dance with the ghost. He is not satisfied with your performance - he looks at you, appalled. "Donâ€™t you know how to dance, lassie?" 
- Go north. 
- Go up the stairs.
- Look at the bookshelf. You now see a book about 19th century dances.
- Read the book.
- Enter the opening.
- Go south.
- Dance with the ghost. He is still not satisfied with your performance. 
- Go north. 
- Go up the stairs.
- Go to the fiction section.
- Go to the kitchen. As soon as you do this, the front door opens and a tourist ask for directions to (some pre-christmas event).
- Lock the front door (or tourists will keep stopping you from entering the kitchen)
- Go to the kitchen.
- Go to the bathroom.
- Practice dancing (applied on mirror, holding the book). "You practice in front of the bathroom mirror."
- Go to the history section.
- Enter the opening.
- Go south.
- Dance. Now, the ghost is satisfied, but finds the room too small.
- Go north.
- Stay one moment (e.g. by examining the female ghost). The male ghost enters.
- Dance with the male ghost.

Cut scene: you dance. When the female ghost sees the dancer, she disappears. The dancer laughs, "she is afraid of ghosts - how ironic". You dance for a while and then he floats back into his room.
