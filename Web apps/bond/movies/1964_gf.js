The golf shop, where Bond and Goldfinger are introduced was located [in front of the clubhouse|golfshop], but has since been removed. The [green of the 18th hole|hole18], where the duel between Bond and Goldfinger culminates, is still located just behind the clubhouse.

In the opening shot we see Goldfinger's Rolls Royce pass [Hotel Belvedere|belvedere] close to the Rhone glacier which can be clearly seen in the background. Next, we see Bond and the Aston Martin leave the small village of [Realp|realp]. I believe that he leaves the village driving east, which does not make much sense, since the following scenes are shot west of the village. Although Bond's \"in-car navigation system\" indicates that Goldfinger is headed north from Geneva, we now see Goldfinger's Rolls Royce pass the [Hotel Galenstock|galenstock], about 300 kilometers away. In the following scene, as a white Mustang catches up with Bond, they pass another house. So far, I have not been able to figure out where this is. We see Tilly passing the [Hotel Belvedere|belvedere] before we get to the scene where [Goldfinger steps out of his car|apple] for a break and an apple.",

New buildings have been erected since, which makes it impossible to get the same view from the road that Bond did.

The plane is a scale model, painted differently on the two sides. Later on in the film when we see the president's plane, it is for obvious reasons flying in the other direction.",

This scene, next to a building stating \"Kentucky Fried Chicken - Col. Sanders' Recipe\" was shot in Miami. The shopping mall located at [that place|kfc] today, still (2019) has a KFC. On the map on Goldfinger's wall, we clearly see [Fort Knox|knox]. A bit later, after Bond - in what may be the silliest scene in the whole franchise - has escaped and overhears the plan, Goldfinger mentions the intersection between Bullion Boulevard and Gold Vault Road.

In the next scene, Oddjob drives north on 7th Avenue and takes [a left|royal_castle] onto 125th Street. The Royal Castle restaurant that he passes is today (2019) called \"Miami Finga Licking\". The two CIA agents then appear from the east, driving straight through the intersection to follow them. We then see them pass the J.D.Ball Ford dealership. In the same [place|ford], Ford is still selling cars. In the end, we end up at the [Atlantic Iron & Metal Company|atlantic] where Mr. Solo has a pressing engagement.",

All outdoor scenes around Fort Knox were built at Pinewood Studios, particularly on the [\"Cobbled Street\" area|cobbled].
