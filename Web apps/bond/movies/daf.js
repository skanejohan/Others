/* TODO
 - In "Looking for Blofeld", source: https://www.onthetracksof007.com/edenroc
 - In "Meeting with Sir Donald", create and use location "diamond_mine_overview"
 - In "Brothers", where was the airport scene taken? Lufthansa's hangar in Frankfurt has been listed, but this might be where Bond meets leiter over the coffin?
 - In "Circus", where is the parking lot where they lose Tiffany?
 - In "The Factory", which road do they travel to get there?
 - In "The chase", the parking lot scene is recorded in Universal City, but where?
 - In "Oil rig", fix the location. It is said to be ouside Oceanside.
 - Mention the Riviera hotel was used for indoor scenes.

 -  The are claims that some of the desert scenes were shot in the Black Rock Desert, but this is questioned on the web page of "Friends of Black Rock High Rock" (http://blackrockdesert.org/wiki/index.php/Motion_Pictures)
 - Is Southampton used? (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamonds_Are_Forever_(film)#Filming)
 - Use pendleton for Blofeld's Oil Rig Lair (don't know which scene). Modify the coordinates - they are currently at the entrance.

Today, however, the [Palm Boulder Highway Mortuary|slumber] is located in a densely populated area. The interior design, with the diamond-shaped window, is said to have been filmed at Pinewood. However, the inside of the mortuary bears a striking resemblance to the final set. At least today, the window doesn't have the psychedelic colors from the movie, but the shape is the same. The \"garden of remembrance\", where Bond is knocked unconscious by mr. Wint and mr. Kidd, is filmed at today's [Palm Downtown Mortuary & Cemetery|remembrance].

Still today, there is a gas station here. We can clearly see the sign for [\"Alpine Village Inn\"|alpine] which was located at 3003 Paradise Road, the [Circus Circus hotel|circus] and the original silver-domed [Las Vegas Convention center|lvcc].

Fremont Street has since been turned into the Fremont Street Experience and covered by a roof, and it is difficult to recognize anything from the movie. The sheriff notices Bond and Tiffany outside the [Las Vegas Club|lvclub] casino (demolished in 2017) and we see him approaching their car from the adjacent [Mint|mint] casino (now a part of Binion's Gambling Hall). Bond turns the car around and drives west on Fremont street, then, after another U-turn, drives east, passing the [Binion's Horseshoe|horseshoe] (today Binion's Gambling Hall). Here we also see the [Golden Nugget|nugget] casino and the [Fremont hotel|fremont], both still in operation. If you look carefully, you realise that these are the only locations we see for a long time during the chase. When Bond drives up on the sidewalk, this is done outside the [Horseshoe|horseshoe]. After a while, we also see the [Pioneer|pioneer] and the [Golden Gate|golden_gate] before Bond leaves Fremont Street opposite the [Fremont hotel|fremont], driving down [Second Street|2nd] (today South Casino Center Boulevard) to get to the parking lot where the police cars will get demolished. The scene in the parking lot was shot at Universal Studios in California. When Bond and Tiffany return and are again discovered by the sheriff, Bond drives into an alley, which is still [there|alley]. The scene where Bond turns the car on two wheels was also recorded in California, but when they re-emerge from the Alley, we are back in Vegas. The [alley where they emerge|lost_alley] was on First Street, but is no longer here.",

The scene where Bond climbs on top of the roof was filmed in the studio, as was the scene where Bond meets the Blofelds again. After Bond has been sedated and taken away by Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd, they drive through a long tunnel and end up in the desert, where Bond is placed in a large pipe. He wakes up inside the pipe after it has become part of a longer pipeline and buried under ground. After destroying a piece of machinery, thus attracting the workers who go there to repair it, Bond escapes from the pipe." ,
