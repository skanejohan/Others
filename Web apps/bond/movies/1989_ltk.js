/*
1. Banco de Isthmus is the Palacio Postal at 4 calle de Tacuba (entrance + indoor scenes)
2. The casino is the Casino Espanol de Mexico, Calle Isabel la Catolica 29
3. Sanchez's office is in Teatro de la Ciudad, 36 Donceles. This is also used for the exterior of the casino.
4. When Bond looks out through the window of Sanchez's office, we clearly see the building at 37 Calle de Tacuba.

The runway used is located at the [Sugarloaf airport|sugarloaf] at Sugarloaf key. We then cut to Bond, Leiter and Sharky on their way to Leiter's wedding. The wedding is supposed to be in Key West, but the initial shot of the limousine driving along the [seven mile|seven] bridge actually shows them driving in the wrong direction. Back to Sanchez, who is now entering the [house|lupe_house] where Lupe Lamora and her lover have an unwise rendez-vous. The indoor scenes were shot in studio. Not Pinewood this time, but on stage 2 of Estudios Churubusco in Mexico City. The helicopter that picks up Bond and Leiter lands [here|heli]. The wedding, where poor Sharky has to deal with an angry bride and her father, takes place at the [St. Mary's Star of the Sea Catholic Church|stmary] in Key West.",

As they drive along the bridges, we clearly see that they are using the old part of the seven mile bridge, which had been replaced by a new one a few years earlier. At this point, the old bridge was still open to traffic, it wasn't until 2008 that it was closed for motorized traffic. The point where the truck exits the road is just south of Knight Key. The underwater scenes were shot in the waters near Isla de Mujeres, off the coast of Cancun, Mexico.",
