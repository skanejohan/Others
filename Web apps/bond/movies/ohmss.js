[Bern's main railway station|bern_hbf] was being rebuilt during filming, and one of the cranes used featured in the film - the device Bond uses to crack Gumbold's safe is transported using it. While Bond is investigating Gumbold's office, Draco and Tracy have a discussion in the car. We can clearly see that this is taken in the [Kramgasse|kramgasse] (\"Grocer's Alley\"), today a partially pedestrian street.

Irma Bunt sees the girls off at what is most likely the Schilthorn cable car station at [Stechelberg|stechelberg], given that the sign at the entrance says \"Gimmelwald Mürren Birg\". Bond fights some of the henchmen in what seems to be a storage area for bells, a fight that makes a horrible noise. Bond then enters the [ice rink|ice_rink] near hotel Regina in Grindelwald, an ice rink that is no longer there. Irma Bunt is seen outside a hotel, telling her goons to \"come on\". According to [this video|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agby3qCQ6YA], this could be current (2014) [hotel Bernerhof|bernerhof]. In these scenes, we clearly see a \"Hotel Oberland\" as well, but I haven't been able to locate that. There is a hotel Oberland in Lauterbrunnen.
